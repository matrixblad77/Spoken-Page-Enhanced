# Spoken Page patch notes

## v1.3.0 — October 1, 2026

- Restore account-scoped library selection, search, sorting, listening status and filters on a fresh visit. Explicit URL options take precedence; browser history remains usable.
- Display separate links for multiple series memberships and sort numeric series positions correctly, including decimal positions.
- Add a compact next-book preview to book details with cover art and direct navigation. Resolve the next available numeric sequence from the entire authorized library, independent of current shelf filters.
- Show progress-save failures even without subtitles, offer Retry now and retry temporary failures with increasing delays while the player remains open. Authentication failures ask the listener to sign in again. No offline storage or player redesign is included.
- Keep Start over beside the listening-status actions for both completed and in-progress books.
- Refine library controls, square cover frames, pin icons and filter layout; include Hide completed and Series sorting.

- Search the complete authorized library before filtering, sorting and pagination; show matching totals, preparation and refresh controls.
- Derive listening status from Audiobookshelf and keep Want to listen separate. Add completion, unfinished and confirmed reset controls with shared updates across library surfaces.
- Back up and migrate existing preferences while retaining pins, recent books, queues and previous manual labels for review.
- Validate read-only compatibility with Audiobookshelf 2.36.1 and define contracts for future offline work. Downloads and player design changes are not included in this checkpoint.

See [review and verification notes](docs/PHASE_0_2_REPORT.md).

## v1.2.1 — September 24, 2026

- Updated Next.js, vulnerable transitive dependencies, and the test runner; refreshed Alpine packages and removed unused npm tooling from the runtime image.
- Kept request-level diagnostics available through `SPOKEN_PAGE_VERBOSE_REQUEST_LOGS=true` while leaving routine request logging off by default. Errors continue to be logged.
- Added Docker Compose log rotation to limit retained container output.

## v1.2.0 — September 24, 2026

- Refreshed the library with a responsive cover gallery, a black canvas, dark red surfaces, and the existing Spoken Page red for accents and section counts.
- Replaced Favorites with compact Pinned books. Existing saved books become pins automatically and remain synced to the user's account; empty pinned sections stay hidden.
- Added Continue listening for the most recently updated unfinished book, with clearer progress, remaining time, Resume, and Mark complete actions.
- Mark complete now updates Audiobookshelf progress and Spoken Page reading status, then removes the book from Continue listening.
- Kept the Spoken Page logo, header typography, and version pill while removing the light theme and its toggle.
- Tightened section and search spacing across phone, tablet, and wide desktop layouts.

## v1.1.2 — September 23, 2026

- Saved, recently played, and queued books now load into their shelves even when they are beyond the first page of the library.
- Kept the main library paginated so large collections still load in manageable pages.

## v1.1.1 — September 23, 2026

- Widened book cards and placed the series name and book number inside each card.
- Added clickable series names on cards and book details to filter the library.
- Added full-name hover text for book titles, authors, and series names on cards.
- Converted HTML-formatted book descriptions into readable text with paragraph breaks.

## v1.1.0 — July 3, 2026

Version 1.1 turns Spoken Page from a single-device companion player into a persistent, account-aware Audiobookshelf experience with a redesigned library and a substantially more capable player.

## New features

- Sign in with an Audiobookshelf username and password without copying an API key to every device.
- Keep encrypted login sessions across app restarts while never storing the Audiobookshelf password; users can sign in normally on each device without copying API keys.
- Sync favorites, recently played books, queues, reading status, subtitle choices, and player preferences through the Spoken Page data volume.
- Install Spoken Page as a PWA and use an offline fallback shell.
- Open a focused player route or pop playback into a separate window.
- Use Media Session controls, expanded keyboard shortcuts, playback speed controls, and a sleep timer.
- Queue the next title in a series.
- Use health and readiness endpoints for container monitoring.

## Library and book details

- Rebuilt the library into responsive, reusable shelves for all books, favorites, recently played, and saved titles.
- Added richer search, sorting, and metadata filters.
- Moved book information into a modal so selecting a title no longer jumps to content at the bottom of the library.
- Books enter Recently Played only after playback begins, not when their details are opened.
- Added expandable long synopses.
- Added manual reading statuses: Planned, In Progress, and Completed, with blank as the default.
- Added per-title favorite, dismiss, and queue actions.
- Standardized buttons, search fields, selectors, spacing, and interaction states across the application.
- Added the current app version to the header.

## Player and subtitles

- Improved multi-track playback and book-wide timeline handling.
- Added consolidated, ordered playback checkpoints to make progress syncing more reliable.
- Added automatic Audiobookshelf token refresh and retry for expired sessions.
- Improved chapter navigation, resume behavior, and player state restoration.
- Added `.vtt` support alongside `.srt`, plus remembered per-book subtitle source and timing offsets.
- Redesigned the sleep timer as a compact, touch-friendly pop-up.
- Updated Resume and Queue Next actions to use the same flat black treatment as player controls.
- Corrected modal close-button alignment and improved tablet sizing throughout the player.

## Deployment and security

- Added encrypted server-side session persistence using AES-256-GCM.
- Added stable secret rotation support with `SPOKEN_PAGE_PREVIOUS_SECRETS`.
- Locked production connections to a configured or allowlisted Audiobookshelf URL by default, reducing SSRF exposure.
- Kept tokens out of browser JavaScript with authenticated server-side proxy routes.
- Added input validation, request-size limits, login throttling, upstream timeouts, private/no-store responses, and structured request IDs.
- Added browser hardening headers for content sniffing, framing, referrers, and unused device permissions.
- Changed the production container to run as an unprivileged user and added persistent data storage plus health checks.
- Expanded CI and container publishing to run type checking, tests, and production builds before publishing.

## Fixes

- Improved reverse-proxy and subpath URL handling.
- Added clearer errors for unreachable, unauthorized, and incorrectly configured Audiobookshelf servers.
- Prevented cross-origin and cross-base-path upstream requests.
- Fixed stale or duplicate playback checkpoint ordering.
- Improved parsing of subtitle timing and malformed upstream responses.
- Fixed recent-book behavior, manual status persistence, modal layout, and several inconsistent control styles.

## Upgrade notes

Set these values before deploying v1.1:

```dotenv
SPOKEN_PAGE_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-value
SPOKEN_PAGE_ABS_BASE_URL=http://your-audiobookshelf-host:13378
```

Keep `SPOKEN_PAGE_SECRET` stable between restarts. The included Compose file automatically creates the persistent `/app/data` volume. Existing users should sign in once after upgrading from the older browser-token connection model.
